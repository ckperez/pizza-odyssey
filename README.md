-Pizza Shop Expansion Project - Code Fellows 201 - Week 2
-Made object literals
-created many interconnecting objects, arrays, and functions. Some of it works...  
## Goal:  
-Build pizza site with public page and behind-the-scenes sales data page  
-Put most of the info on the html pages through DOM manipulation  
-Make stuff work.  
## Results:  
-Form on sales-data page accepts a whole day's worth of information for a new location. New location name is generated, PizzaLocation object is generated, and table is populated on submit. Generated table features several attributes so that styling can be matched with existing tables. Image was saved and renamed for SEO purposes. CSS is minimal with stark near-blacks, near-whites, and bright orange... because future. Table rows alternate in color for easy reading.
